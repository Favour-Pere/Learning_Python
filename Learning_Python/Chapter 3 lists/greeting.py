#  Greetings: Start with the list you used in Exercise 3-1, but instead of just 
# printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the 
# person’s name.

name = ["Favour", "Rejoice", "Fortune", "Benedict", "Sopreye"]

print("Hello " + name[0])
print("Hello " + name[1])
print("Hello " + name[2])
print("Hello " + name[3])
print("Hello " + name[4])
